# HAL TEMPLATE GUIDE

If you need to add a driver for a specific chip of a specific series from a specific manufacturer,  you can refer to the `__series_template__` and `__series_name__` folders of the current directory.

If you need to implement a new hal module, you can refer to the `__module_template__` folder.
